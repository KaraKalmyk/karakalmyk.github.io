Livestock breeding has always been at the heart of the Sart-Kalmyk way of life. They are descendants of nomads, and this deep connection with the land and animals defines their culture today, albeit in completely new forms.

## Livestock Breeding — The Soul of the People

### Nomadic Past

Having migrated to the shores of Issyk-Kul in the 19th century, the Sart-Kalmyks returned to lands that once were part of the Dzungar Khanate — the state of their Oirat ancestors. Here they continued to do what they knew best — breeding livestock. Horses, camels, cows, sheep, and goats grazed freely year-round, being driven from one pasture to another. The names of ancestral summer pastures (zuslng) and winter camps (üvlzng), named after their ancestors, still live in the memory of the elderly: Khabady's summer pasture or Emgin's winter camp.

### The Blow of the Soviet Era

By the beginning of the 20th century, the nomadic lifestyle was gradually being replaced by a semi-nomadic one. But the real shock came with collectivization in 1929–1932. It led to a sharp reduction in livestock numbers. Not wanting to give up their property to collective farms, many wealthy families were forced to flee with their herds to neighboring China. Their descendants still live there today, alongside their Olet relatives. Further Soviet policies also did not contribute to the development of private livestock farming.

### Modern Renaissance

Today, the life of the Sart-Kalmyks is experiencing a true livestock renaissance. Private farms are growing and developing. From April to September, modern herders, like their ancestors, drive their herds to high-altitude summer pastures — jailoo (in Sart-Kalmyk, zuslng). And with the onset of cold weather, they return to the villages, where fodder has already been prepared for the livestock.

Moreover, residents of Sart-Kalmyk villages have become key milk suppliers for factories near the city of Karakol. Livestock farming has once again become an important source of income, and the famous Sunday cattle market in Karakol — "Mal Bazar" — is the center of the region's economic life.

## Agriculture — Ancestral Wisdom and New Horizons

Alongside livestock breeding, the Sart-Kalmyks have long engaged in agriculture.

### Ancient Technologies

Surprisingly, the Oirats practiced agriculture in these lands as early as the 17th century. The best evidence of this is the remains of ancient irrigation systems, which locals call "kalmak aryk" (Kalmyk canal). According to old-timers, these canals were designed so wisely that they do not disturb the natural landscape and continue to function properly to this day!

### From Fields for the Poor to Export Harvests

At the beginning of the 20th century, agriculture was considered an occupation mainly for poor families, while the wealthy preferred livestock breeding. Under the influence of neighbors — Russians, Ukrainians, and Dungans — the Sart-Kalmyks began to pay more attention to growing wheat (taran), barley (ärvä), and other crops.

After the collapse of the USSR and the dissolution of collective farms, agriculture reached a new level. Today, the fields of Sart-Kalmyk villages grow grains, potatoes, cabbage, and the orchards yield rich harvests of apples (älmn), apricots (örg), and currants (khad). This produce not only supplies the local market but is also exported to Kazakhstan and Russia.

## Hunting — A Fading Tradition

Once, hunting was an important part of life. Wild animal meat was eaten, and furs served as a kind of currency. The Sart-Kalmyks were famous as skilled hunters, including with hunting eagles.

Today, traditional hunting has almost disappeared into the past. Only a few continue to practice it with hunting birds and dogs. Nowadays, hunting is more of a regulated hobby, available in certain seasons with special permits.
