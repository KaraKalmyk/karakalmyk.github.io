The Sart-Kalmyks, a small ethnic group of Oirat (Mongolian) origin living mainly in the Issyk-Kul region of Kyrgyzstan, today practice Sunni Islam. However, their religious journey was not straightforward and is full of interesting historical turns, traces of which are preserved in their language and culture.

## Conversion to Islam

According to historical evidence, the first group of Sart-Kalmyks who arrived in the territory of modern Kyrgyzstan in 1863 were already Muslim. Nevertheless, researchers from the early 20th century noted that religiosity among them was not very strong, and they did not even have their own mullahs.

Interestingly, two later groups of settlers who arrived in 1884 and 1894 were Buddhists, who were called "kara-kalmaks," meaning "black Kalmyks." Over time, under the influence of the surrounding Muslim population, they also accepted Islam.

## Memory of the Buddhist Past

Despite the complete conversion to Islam, traces of their Buddhist past are preserved in Sart-Kalmyk culture. For example, in the first period after resettlement, they buried the dead according to Buddhist customs: cremating bodies or leaving them in the wilderness. Also, before the revolution, they sought medical help not only from Russian doctors but also from Buddhist lamas from Tekes (territory of modern China).

Traces of Buddhism can also be found in the language of the Sart-Kalmyks. Words associated with Buddhist vocabulary have been preserved, such as:

- **Arshan** — healing water (from Sanskrit "rashiani" — nectar, drink of the gods).
- **Machg** — fast (used to denote the Muslim fast "uraza").
- **Gengğä** — respectful address to a monk.
- **Names of Tibetan origin,** for example, Chimd ("long life") and Jimb ("giving").

Moreover, material evidence of the presence of Buddhism has been preserved in the region. On the southern shore of Lake Issyk-Kul, in the territory that once belonged to the Dzungar Khanate, one can find boulder stones with the Buddhist prayer "Om mani padme hum" carved in Tibetan script.

## Islam in the Life of Modern Sart-Kalmyks

Today, Islam is an integral part of Sart-Kalmyk society. The first mosque in the Issyk-Kul region was built by the Sart-Kalmyks in the village of Chelpek in 1889, and people still call it the "Kalmyk mosque." During Soviet times, the building was used as a warehouse, but in the early 1990s, it was reopened for worshippers.

Currently, four mosques operate in Sart-Kalmyk villages, built with the support of Arab charitable organizations. The male population actively participates in Friday prayers and celebrates Muslim holidays. Sart-Kalmyks observe such important Islamic rites as circumcision (sunnet), marriage under Sharia law (nikah), and the funeral rite (janaza).

Young people show interest in studying Islam, receiving education in religious institutions of Kyrgyzstan. Every year, several people perform the pilgrimage (hajj) to Saudi Arabia. The number of those who observe the fast during Ramadan and perform the five daily prayers is also growing. Despite close cultural contacts with Buddhist Kalmyks from Russia, the Sart-Kalmyks maintain their Muslim identity.
