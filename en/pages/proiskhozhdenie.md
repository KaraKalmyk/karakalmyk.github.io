The Sart-Kalmyks are an amazing people whose history is full of mysteries. They have no written heritage of their own, so scholars and local historians have to piece together their past bit by bit, relying on oral traditions and scarce historical documents.

## Two Theories of Origin

The main question that still has no definitive answer: where did the Sart-Kalmyks come from? There are two main theories:

- **Mixed origin.** Some 19th-century researchers believed that the ancestors of the Sart-Kalmyks were Uzbek and Kyrgyz men who married women from the Oirat tribe of Olets living in the Tekes region (modern China).
- **Pure Oirat roots.** This version is supported by the Sart-Kalmyks themselves. According to their legends, their ancestors are pure-blooded Olets (one of the Western Mongolian tribes) who migrated from Xinjiang.

## Four Waves of Migration

Oral traditions collected by local historians tell of four main waves of Oirat migration to the territory of modern Kyrgyzstan in the second half of the 19th century.

- **First wave (1863):** 60 families (in Kalmyk — җирн өрк) came from the Urumqi direction and founded the village of Börü-Bash ("Wolf's Head").
- **Second wave (1876):** A new group arrived in Börü-Bash, and later, having received land from the authorities, moved on and founded the present village of Chelpek (from Kalmyk tselv — "round flatbread").
- **Third and fourth waves (1884 and 1894):** These groups of settlers were special. Unlike the first ones, who already professed Islam, the newcomers were Buddhists. Locals called them "kara-kalmak" ("black Kalmyks"). Over time, they also converted to Islam, but this name remained in history.

By the beginning of the 20th century, the Sart-Kalmyks were officially recognized as a separate administrative unit — the Sart-Kalmyk Volost.

## Clan Organization: "Seven Fathers" and Century-Old Bonds

Like many nomadic peoples, the Sart-Kalmyks are divided into clans (yasn). Among the most numerous are the Bayımbakhy and Karabaatyr ("black hero"). Other clans have beautiful and descriptive names, such as Shonkur ("falcon") or Kara-köz ("black eye").

The Sart-Kalmyks, like their Kyrgyz neighbors, have a strict prohibition on marriages between relatives up to the seventh generation. This principle of collective responsibility and clan memory is called "dolan echk" ("seven fathers"). Interestingly, this is probably a direct translation of the Kyrgyz expression "jety ata," since other Kalmyks and Oirats use the term "dolan üi" ("seven generations"). This is a vivid example of cultural interpenetration between the two peoples.

## The Mystery of Population Numbers: From Thousands to Tens of Thousands

The history of Sart-Kalmyk censuses reads like a detective story:

- **Late 19th - early 20th centuries:** The population grew steadily — from just over 1,000 people in 1889 to almost 3,600 in 1929.
- **Late 20th century:** By 1989, more than 5,000 Sart-Kalmyks lived in two main village councils.
- **2009 census:** An inexplicable, at first glance, drop occurred — the official population was cut almost in half, to 2,805 people.

So where did the people go? The answer lies in a complex system of self-identification. According to unofficial data, the actual number of Sart-Kalmyks ranges from 10,000 to 25,000 people. Many of them simply register themselves as Kyrgyz when obtaining documents. This is their personal choice, but it creates an amazing paradox: an officially "disappearing" people is actually living and developing, preserving its unique culture and memory of ancestors.
