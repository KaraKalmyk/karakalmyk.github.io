  <div class="prose" markdown="1">

The small Sart-Kalmyk community living in Kyrgyzstan has its own native language, which they call "khälmyg kelän" (Kalmyk language). This language is a living fragment of the rich Mongolic language family, but unfortunately, today it is on the verge of complete extinction.

## What Kind of Language Is This?

Scholars consider the Sart-Kalmyk language to be one of the dialects of the Oirat language, to which the Kalmyk language in Russia also belongs. Interestingly, in its sound and grammar, it turned out to be even closer to the language of the Oirats living in Xinjiang (China) than to literary Kalmyk. This is a unique dialect that has absorbed the history of migrations and contacts with other peoples.

## History of Language Decline

At the beginning of the 20th century, the situation was different. Researchers of that time noted that Sart-Kalmyk was a living household language: the older generation knew it well, but young people already spoke it weaker. Even then, all Sart-Kalmyks were fluent in Kyrgyz, which gradually displaced their native speech even from domestic use.

By the 1970s, only the older generation spoke Sart-Kalmyk at home. In the 20th century, attempts were made to revive the language: in the 1930s and 1990s, teachers came from Kalmykia at the request of the Sart-Kalmyks to teach children. Unfortunately, these visits were short-term and could not fundamentally change the situation.

The situation became critical by our time. During an expedition in 2021, researchers surveyed 100 Sart-Kalmyks, and only 20 of them could speak their native language. Today, there are practically no speakers left, and the few who remember the language speak it with strong influence from the dominant Kyrgyz.

## Lost Writing System

Once upon a time, the Sart-Kalmyks had their own unique writing system — the vertical Oirat script known as "todo bichig" ("clear script"). Having moved to the territory of the Russian Empire in the second half of the 19th century and finding themselves surrounded by Kyrgyz and Russian languages, they gradually lost their skills. The beautiful vertical script was replaced by the Arabic alphabet (common among the Kyrgyz) and Cyrillic. Copies of letters written by Sart-Kalmyks in the 1920s-1930s have even been preserved, where they used Cyrillic and Latin scripts.

## Attempts to Preserve the Heritage

Despite the decline of the language, there were those who tried to preserve it for posterity. In the 1990s, Sultan Nasybatov (born 1925), a resident of Chelpek village, on his own initiative began to compile a handwritten "Kyrgyz-Sart-Kalmyk-Russian Dictionary." He recorded words of his native dialect on ordinary sheets of paper, creating an invaluable monument to a dying language. Today, a copy of this manuscript is kept in researchers' private archives.

The history of the Sart-Kalmyk language is a vivid example of how quickly unique cultural heritage can disappear. Every dying language is an irretrievable loss for all humanity.
