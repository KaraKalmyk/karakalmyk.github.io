The culture of the Sart-Kalmyks is a unique interweaving of their nomadic Mongolian past and the traditions of the Central Asian peoples they have lived alongside for over a century and a half. Let's look into their homes, get acquainted with their cuisine, and learn how their ancestral heritage continues to live in their everyday life today.

## From Nomadic Yurt to Modern Home

At the beginning of the 20th century, many Sart-Kalmyks, especially those engaged in cattle breeding, lived in traditional yurts. Wealthy families could have several yurts: a main one and guest yurts, and their interior was already similar to Kyrgyz style. However, families with average means preserved the old Mongolian type of yurt longer. The original Kalmyk names for these dwellings still live in the memory of the older generation: ishkä ger ("yurt"), bor ger ("gray yurt of a commoner"), or jolm ger (a simplified yurt made of poles and felt).

The first permanent houses of the Sart-Kalmyks were long adobe buildings with flat roofs, resembling dugouts. Interestingly, both the construction technology and street layout were adopted, like their Kyrgyz neighbors, from Russian and Ukrainian settlers of the 19th century.

Today, the Sart-Kalmyks live in modern one- and two-story brick houses. But even in the most contemporary interior with factory furniture and carpets, you can see a reminder of the nomadic past — traditional chests (avdr), on which blankets and pillows are neatly stacked. This stack is called baran in Kalmyk. The courtyards often have a separate summer kitchen with several stoves and cauldrons, as well as a clay tandoor oven for baking aromatic bread.

## Objects That Preserve Memory

Although today the household items of the Sart-Kalmyks are almost indistinguishable from those of the Kyrgyz, the older generation still remembers old Kalmyk names for many things:

- **Dishes:** khääsn (cauldron), khashg (spoon), shaaznğ (cup), tavg (large wooden platter for meat).
- **Clothing:** khuvčn (clothing), šalvr (pants), makhla (hat), devl (sheepskin coat).
- **Home furnishings:** orn (bed), könžil (blanket), širdg (quilted felt).

## Symbols of Wealth on Headdresses

Old photographs from the early 20th century have preserved an amazing detail: women's and children's caps of Sart-Kalmyks and their Olet relatives were richly decorated with buttons, silver coins, and shells. This was not just decoration but a powerful wishing symbol. When sewing coins onto a cap, it was customary to pronounce a blessing: "May your round head be in gold and silver!" This tradition was even reflected in folk songs, where a child's beauty is compared to the shine of mother-of-pearl on their cap.

## Cuisine: Kyrgyz Influence and Kalmyk Recipes

The modern cuisine of the Sart-Kalmyks is very close to Kyrgyz, but it has preserved its own unique, traditional dishes:

- **Khärlsn chä** (or kuurma chai in Kyrgyz) — the famous Kalmyk milk tea with salt and fried flour.
- **Budan** — a thick noodle soup with finely chopped meat.
- **Čiksn makhn** (Kyrgyz equivalent: chuchuk) — traditional horse sausage.
- **Tohsh** (kalmak nan) — a special Kalmyk flatbread.

Bread is considered the main product on the table. A respected guest is first served a bowl of milk tea with butter and finely crumbled pieces of fresh bread — this is a sign of special respect.

## Spiritual Heritage: Unexplored Archives

The folklore of the Sart-Kalmyks — songs, dance melodies played on the two-stringed plucked instrument tovshur, proverbs, and blessings — began to attract the attention of scholars a hundred years ago. However, many recordings made in the 20th century are still kept in archives and private collections, waiting for their researcher. This is invaluable heritage that has yet to be revealed to the world.
